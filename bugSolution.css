To solve this issue, we can add a `min-width` property to ensure the div never has a negative width:

```css
div {
  width: calc(50% - 10px);
  min-width: 0;
  background-color: lightblue;
}
```

The `min-width: 0;` declaration guarantees that the div's width will never be less than zero, preventing the unexpected rendering behavior.  Alternatively, more robust solutions could involve using `max()` to cap the width calculation at zero, or a more sophisticated approach to sizing depending on the container's context.
